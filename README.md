## Database

This is a demo web-app for a free tool lending community library.

It is currently running on heroku:

https://fast-temple-14445.herokuapp.com/completeToolLis

It has two user modes: user or librarian.  A user can log in and edit their personal information and view what tools they have currently checked out and what tools are available.

A librarian can sign up members and check tools in and out to members.

The back end is in the java spring MVC framework.  It uses a postgresql database. The databse folder has a bash script and several sql scripts to set up the database.  It uses the minified versions of jquery and bootstrap.  It has DAO integration tests built in.
